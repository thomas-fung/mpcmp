abstract = {Many large urban areas experience elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone pollution, which is reported to cause adverse effects on human health and the environment. The prediction of ground-level ozone is an important topic, which attracts attention from research communities and policy makers. This study investigates the potential Of using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network technique to predict daily maximum ozone levels in the Bangkok urban area. The MLP was trained and validated using ambient air quality monitoring data and observed meteorological data for the high ozone months (January to April) in the area during a four year period, 2000-2003. The inputs to the MLP included the average concentration of air pollutants (nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and non-methane hydrocarbon) and meteorological variables (wind speed and direction, relative humidity, temperature. and solar radiation) during the morning rush hours. The MLP network, which contained 8 input layer neurons, two hidden layers (10 hidden neurons for the first hidden layer, 14 hidden neurons for the second hidden layer) and 1 output layer neuron, was found to give satisfactory predictions for both the training and validated data sets. The performance of the MLP was better than the multivariable linear regression model developed based on the same dataset. For the validated dataset, the MLP predicted the daily maximum 1-h ozone concentration in the study area with a mean absolute error of 10.3 ppb, a root mean square error of 13.5 ppb, a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.85, and an index of agreement of 0.89.},

@article{Hakim2016,
abstract = {An “offline” approach to DA is used, where static ensemble samples are drawn from existing CMIP climate-model simulations to serve as the prior estimate of climate variables.We use linear, univariate forward models (“proxy systemmodels (PSMs)”) that map climate variables to proxy measurements by fitting proxy data to 2mair temperature fromgridded instrumental temperature data; the linear PSMs are then used to predict proxy values from the prior estimate. Results for the LMR are compared against six gridded instrumental temperature data sets and 25{\%} of the proxy records are withheld from assimilation for independent verification. Results show broad agreement with previous reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere mean 2mair temperature, with millennial-scale cooling, a multicentennial warm period around 1000 C.E., and a cold period coincident with the Little Ice Age (circa 1450–1800 C.E.). Verification against gridded instrumental data sets during 1880–2000 C.E. reveals greatest skill in the tropics and lowest skill over Northern Hemisphere land areas. Verification against independent proxy records indicates substantial improvement relative to the model (prior) data without proxy assimilation. As an illustrative example, we present multivariate reconstructed fields for a singular event, the 1808/1809 “mystery” volcanic eruption, which reveal global cooling that is strongly enhanced locally due to the presence of the Pacific-North America wave pattern in the 500 hPa geopotential height field},

abstract = {We prove that the generalized Poisson distribution GP(theta, eta) (eta {\textgreater} or = 0) is a mixture of Poisson distributions; this is a new property for a distribution which is the topic of the book by Consul (1989). Because we find that the fits to count data of the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions are often similar, to understand their differences, we compare the probability mass functions and skewnesses of the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions with the first two moments fixed. They have slight differences in many situations, but their zero-inflated distributions, with masses at zero, means and variances fixed, can differ more. These probabilistic comparisons are helpful in selecting a better fitting distribution for modelling count data with long right tails. Through a real example of count data with large zero fraction, we illustrate how the generalized Poisson and negative binomial distributions as well as their zero-inflated distributions can be discriminated.},

We use the pair-copula decomposition of a general multivariate distribution and propose a method for performing inference. The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks. Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology to a financial data set. Our approach represents the first step towards the development of an unsupervised algorithm that explores the space of possible pair-copula models, that also can be applied to huge data sets automatically. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Pearce2011,
abstract = {Recent acknowledgement of the sensitivity of air quality to changes in climate has initiated a closer examination of the relationships between meteorology and air quality. This paper presents the estimated response of daily air pollutant concentrations in Melbourne, Australia to local-scale meteorology. The meteorological-pollutant relationships have been assessed after controlling for long-term trends, seasonality, weekly emissions, spatial variation, and temporal persistence using the framework of generalized additive models (GAMs). Overall, results found that the aggregate impact of meteorological variables in the models explained 26.3{\%} of the variance in O3, 21.1{\%} in PM10, and 26.7{\%} in NO2. This indicates that meteorology - at the local-scale, is a relatively strong driver of air quality in Melbourne. Analysis of partial residuals plots found that changes in temperature, particularly when above 35 ??C, resulted in the strongest positive response for O3 (150{\%}), PM10 (150{\%}) and NO2 (120{\%}). Other variables (boundary layer height, winds, water vapor pressure, radiation, precipitation, and mean sea-level pressure) displayed some importance for one or more of the pollutants, but their impact in the models was less pronounced. In sum, we provide results that form a solid foundation for understanding the importance of local-scale meteorology as a driver of regional air pollution. Additionally, these results can be used to provide a window into how changes in climate may affect air quality. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Bleaching causes mortality when temperature stress persists but exposure to bleaching conditions is not expected to be spatially uniform at the regional or global scale2. Here we show the first maps of global projections of bleaching conditions based on ensembles of IPCC AR5 (ref. 3) models forced with the new Representative Concentration Pathways4 (RCPs). For the three RCPs with larger CO2 emissions (RCP 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) the onset of annual bleaching conditions is associated with {\{}{\~{}}{\}} 510 ppm CO2 equivalent; the median year of all locations is 2040 for the fossil-fuel aggressive RCP 8.5.

Some of these temporary refugia include the western Indian Ocean, Thailand, the southern Great Barrier Reef and central French Polynesia.

abstract = {A set of 12 daily weather types has been obtained for the New Zealand region from the 51-year NCAR/NCEP dataset by using a two-stage classification procedure (rotated T-mode principal component analysis followed by convergent K-means clustering). Analysis of this classification confirms previous studies and provides further insight into the variation features of the regional synoptic weather on the seasonal, interannual and longer-time scales. There are seasonal variations in both intensity and frequency of synoptic weather types. For example, southern highs are more frequent in summer and autumn, while troughs and lows occur more often in winter and secondarily spring. The high and low centres of weather types tend to be more intense in winter than summer. The frequency and lifetime of synoptic weather types fluctuate on the interannual and decadal scales; there exist significant correlations between frequencies of individual weather types and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). In all seasons, the frequencies of weather types can change with phases of SOI. The most significant changes in weather type frequencies during the negative SOI phase occur in spring, and characterized by more frequent occurrence of weather types which provide prevailing southwesterly to westerly winds and reduced prominence of anticyclonic situations. The most significant changes in type frequencies during the positive SOI phase occur in summer, with more frequent anticyclonic types but less frequent cyclonic types. The frequency change in winter seems different from other seasons, although consistent with previous studies. In addition, the probability of extremely frequent occurrence or lack of occurrence of certain weather types during a month also varies significantly with SOI phases and with seasons, indicating that the chance for extreme weather conditions to occur is conditional on SOI. The results can be useful for climate forecasts, studies of climate extremes, air pollution, climatic impacts on human health and other environmental problems.},

This distribution generalizes the Poisson distribution by adding a parameter to model over-dispersion and under-dispersion and includes the geometric distribution as a special case and the Bernoulli distribution as a limiting case. In this paper, we propose a generalized COM-Poisson (GCOM-Poisson) distribution with three parameters, which includes the negative binomial distribution as a special case, and can become a longer-tailed model than the COM-Poisson distribution. The new parameter plays the role of controlling length of tail. The GCOM-Poisson distribution can become a bimodal distribution where one of the modes is at zero and is applicable to count data with excess zeros. Estimation methods are also discussed for the GCOM-Poisson distribution.},

This model allows for over-dispersion via the nature of the repeated measures; however, departures from equi-dispersion can also exist due to the underlying count process mechanism. We present an extension of the cross-sectional Conway-Maxwell- Poisson (COM-Poisson) regression model established by Sellers and Shmueli (2010) – a generalized regression model for count data in light of inherent data dispersion – to incorporate random effects for analysis of longitudinal count data. We detail how to fit the COM-Poisson longitudinal model via a user- defined log-likelihood function in PROC NLMIXED.

abstract = {Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are flexible generalizations of the Poisson distribution for modelling overdispersed or underdispersed counts. The main hindrance to their wider use in practice seems to be the inability to directly model the mean of counts, making them not compatible with nor comparable to competing count regression models, such as the log-linear Poisson, negative-binomial or generalized Poisson regression models. This note illustrates how CMP distributions can be parametrized via the mean, so that simpler and more easily-interpretable mean-models can be used, such as a log-linear model. Other link functions are also available, of course. In addition to establishing attractive theoretical and asymptotic properties of the proposed model, its good finite-sample performance is exhibited through various examples and a simulation study based on real datasets. Moreover, the MATLAB routine to fit the model to data is demonstrated to be up to an order of magnitude faster than the current software to fit standard CMP models, and over two orders of magnitude faster than the recently proposed hyper-Poisson model.},

We show that, out of the six sectors analyzed, there is a significant contagion effect in ‘Commerce', ‘Services' and ‘Transport'. Moreover, we show that the non-Gaussian modelling of the common factor provides a better characterization than its Gaussian counterpart for the ‘Services' sector. This result has a significant impact on the shape and the corresponding Value-at-Risk levels of the ‘Services' credit loss distribution.

We show that there is no Archimedean copula with constant interactions. The interaction function is positive (negative) for an Archimedean copula density whose second derivative of the generator is log convex (log concave). Moreover, the only Archimedean copula with interactions proportional to its density is Frank's copula. We obtain some preliminary results concerning the connection between the behaviour of the interaction function and the tail dependence of the distribution.

abstract = {Excess zeroes are often thought of as a cause of data over-dispersion (i.e. when the variance exceeds the mean); this claim is not entirely accurate. In actuality, excess zeroes reduce the mean of a dataset, thus inflating the dispersion index (i.e. the variance divided by the mean). While this results in an increased chance for data over-dispersion, the implication is not guaranteed. Thus, one should consider a flexible distribution that not only can account for excess zeroes, but can also address potential over- or under-dispersion. A zero-inflated Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (ZICMP) regression allows for modeling the relationship between explanatory and response variables, while capturing the effects due to excess zeroes and dispersion. This work derives the ZICMP model and illustrates its flexibility, extrapolates the corresponding likelihood ratio test for the presence of significant data dispersion, and highlights various statistical properties and model fit through several examples.},

abstract = {Twenty-five years of volatility research has left the macroeconomic environment playing a minor role. This paper proposes modeling equity volatilities as a combination of macro- economic effects and time series dynamics. High-frequency return volatility is specified to be the product of a slow-moving component, represented by an exponential spline, and a unit GARCH. This slow-moving component is the low-frequency volatility, which in this model coincides with the unconditional volatility. This component is estimated for nearly 50 countries over various sample periods of daily data. Low-frequency volatility is then modeled as a function of macroeconomic and financial variables in an unbalanced panel with a variety of dependence structures. It is found to vary over time and across countries. The low-frequency component of volatility is greater when the macroeconomic factors of GDP, inflation, and short-term interest rates are more volatile or when inflation is high and output growth is low. Volatility is higher not only for emerging markets and markets with small numbers of listed companies andmarket capitalization relative to GDP, but also for large economies. The model allows long horizon forecasts of volatility to depend on macroeconomic developments, and delivers estimates of the volatility to be anticipated in a newly opened market.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Through applying a new noise filtering technique to a global network of late Holocene SST proxies, we estimate SST variability between annual and millennial timescales. Filtered estimates of SST variability obtained from coral, foraminifer, and alkenone records are shown to be consistent with one another and with instrumental records in the frequency bands at which they overlap. General circulation models, however, simulate SST variability that is systematically smaller than instrumental and proxy-based estimates. Discrepancies in variability are largest at low latitudes and increase with timescale, reaching two orders of magnitude for tropical variability at millennial timescales. This result implies major deficiencies in observational estimates or model simulations, or both, and has implications for the attribution of past variations and prediction of future change.},

abstract = {Abstract Significant changes in the insurance and financial markets are giving increasing attention to the need for developing a standard framework for risk measurement. Recently, there has been growing interest among insurance and investment experts to focus on the use of a tail conditional expectation because it shares properties that are considered desirable and applicable in a variety of situations. In particular, it satisfies requirements of a ?coherent? risk measure in the spirit developed by Artzner et al. (1999). This paper derives explicit formulas for computing tail conditional expectations for elliptical distributions, a family of symmetric distributions that includes the more familiar normal and student-t distributions. The authors extend this investigation to multivariate elliptical distributions allowing them to model combinations of correlated risks. They are able to exploit properties of these distributions, naturally permitting them to decompose the conditional expectation, and allocate the contribution of individual risks to the aggregated risks. This is meaningful in practice, particularly in the case of computing capital requirements for an institution that may have several lines of correlated business and is concerned about fairly allocating the total capital to these constituents.},

abstract = {The Conway-Maxwell Poisson (CMP) regression is a popular model for count data due to its ability to capture both under dispersion and over dispersion. However, CMP regression is limited when dealing with complex nonlinear relationships. With today's wide availability of count data, especially due to the growing collection of data on human and social behavior, there is need for count data models that can capture complex nonlinear relationships. One useful approach is additive models. However, there has been no additive model implementation for CMP. To fill this void, we first propose a flexible estimation framework for CMP regression based on iterative reweighed least squares (IRLS) and then extend this model to allow for additive components using smoothing splines. Because CMP belongs to the exponential family, convergence is guaranteed for IRLS and it is more efficient than the numerical optimization. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach through extensive simulation studies and using real data from a bike sharing system in Washington, DC.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. A score-type statistic, T, is introduced for testing H: 4A = 0 against K: 4 2 0 and more general one-sided hypotheses when nuisance parameters may be present; 4' is a vector parameter. The main advantages of Ts are that it requires estimation of the model only under the null hypothesis and that, it is asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio statistic; these are precisely the reasons for the popularity of the score tests for testing against two-sided alternatives. In this sense, Ts preserves the main attractive features of the classical two-sided score test. The theoretical results are presented in a general framework where the likelihood-based score function is replaced by an estimating function so that the test is applicable even if the exact population distribution is unknown. Computation of T7 is simplified by the fact that it can be computed easily once the corresponding two-sided statistic has been computed. The relevance and simplicity of Ts are illustrated by discussing a data example in detail. This example involves an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model, and the objective is to test for the presence of ARCH effect. The null and alternative hypotheses turn out to be of the form H: 4' = 0 and K: 4' 2 0 respectively where 4' is the vector of ARCH parameters. In contrast to the likelihood ratio and other equivalent forms that are currently available for testing against such one-sided hypotheses, we note the following: T7 is convenient to apply, because the full ARCH model need not be estimated subject to the inequality constraint ' ? 0 and we do not need to know the exact likelihood because T7 is based on estimating equations rather than likelihoods.},

abstract = {Description: Critically acclaimed and resoundingly popular in its first edition, Modelling Survival Data in Medical Research has been thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the many developments and advances--particularly in software--made in the field over the last 10 years. Now, more than ever, it provides an outstanding text for upper-level and graduate courses in survival analysis, biostatistics, and time-to-event analysis. The treatment begins with an introduction to survival analysis and a description of four studies that lead to survival data. Subsequent chapters then use those data sets and others to illustrate the various analytical techniques applicable to such data, including the Cox regression model, the Weibull proportional hazards model, and others. This edition features a more detailed treatment of topics such as parametric models, accelerated failure time models, and analysis of interval-censored data. The author also focuses the software section on the use of SAS, summarising the methods used by the software to generate its output and examining that output in detail. All of the data sets used in the book are available for download from www.crcpress.com/e{\_}products/downloads. Profusely illustrated with examples and written in the author's trademark, easy-to-follow style, Modelling Survival Data in Medical Research, Second Edition is a thorough, practical guide to survival analysis that reflects current statistical practices.},

The time series constitutes a linear process across time and between components. The input noise of the linear process has regularly varying tails with index $\alpha$ ∈ (0, 4); in particular, the time series has infinite fourth moment. We derive the limiting behavior for the largest eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix and show point process convergence of the normalized eigenvalues. The limiting process has an explicit form involving points of a Poisson process and eigenvalues of a non-negative definite matrix. Based on this convergence we derive limit theory for a host of other continuous functionals of the eigenvalues, including the joint convergence of the largest eigenvalues, the joint convergence of the largest eigenvalue and the trace of the sample covariance matrix, and the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to their sum.},

abstract = {We study variance estimation in a negative binomial regression model for analyzing time series of counts, where serial dependence among the observed counts is introduced by an autocorrelated latent process. The regression coefficient vector is estimated by maximizing the pseudo-likelihood with the latent process suppressed. The resulting estimator is referred to as the generalized linear model estimator, and its consistency and asymptotic normality have been established by Davis and Wu [R.A. Davis, R. Wu, A negative binomial model for time series of counts, Biometrika 96 (2009) 735-749] when the latent process is stationary and strongly mixing. However, in order to perform valid statistical inferences about the regression coefficients, it is essential to develop a consistent estimation procedure for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the generalized linear model estimator. We propose two types of estimators using kernel-based and subsampling methods, and establish their consistency property. The results can be generalized straightforwardly to time series following a parameter-driven generalized linear model. Simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the estimation methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Frequently count time series exhibit overdispersion, but the opposite phenomenon of underdispersion is well documented in some situations, thus may be encountered in real applications. The INGARCH model is a popular tool for modeling time series of counts. The Poisson and negative binomial models can only deal with overdispersion, and the double Poisson and generalized Poisson models can treat both of them, but the latter two models have some shortcomings or limitations. The revived COM-Poisson distribution is flexible in modeling a wide range of overdispersion and underdispersion with only two parameters, while possessing properties that make it methodologically appealing and useful in practice, thus we introduce a new INGARCH model based on this distribution. Wegive an approximate condition for stationarity and expressions for mean, variance and autocorrelation function and test the accuracy of these expressions via simulations and real examples. We discuss the maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the parameters of interest. In addition, we also try to find influences of different distributions on INGARCH models using three real data sets. The results show that the generalized Poisson and COM-Poisson models perform well in most cases and the COM-Poisson model is a powerful competitor compared with the generalized Poisson model.},

We show that the probability of the joint occurrence of extreme stock returns may be higher for asymmetric thresholds than for symmetric thresholds. We propose a non-parametric measure of extreme dependence which allows capturing extreme events for different thresholds and can be used to compute different types of extreme dependence. We find that extreme dependence among the stock markets of ten initial EMU member countries, the United Kingdom, and the United States is largely asymmetrical in the pre-EMU period (1989-1998) and largely symmetrical in the EMU period (1999-2010). Our findings suggest that ignoring the possibility of asymmetric extreme dependence may lead to an underestimation of the probability of co-booms and co-crashes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This works well in some circumstances but non-convergence remains a possibility, particularly with a nonstandard link function. In some cases this is because step-halving is never invoked, despite a lack of convergence. In other cases step-halving is invoked but is unable to induce convergence. One remedy is to impose a stricter form of stephalving than is currently available in glm, so that the deviance is forced to decrease in every iteration. This has been implemented in the glm2 function available in the glm2 package. Aside from a modified computational algorithm, glm2 operates in exactly the same way as glm and provides improved convergence properties. These improvements are illustrated here with an identity link Poisson model, but are also relevant in other contexts.},

The proposed model shows robustness to violations of normality assumptions of the underlying latent factors and provides flexibility in capturing extra skewness as well as heavier tails of the observed data. A computationally feasible ECM algorithm is developed for computing maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. The usefulness of the proposed methodology is illustrated by a real-life example and results also demonstrates its better performance over various existing methods.},

The results show that the mean concentrations of PM2.5 (O3) decreased (increased) at the urban and rural stations over the last decade. The linear trends of the annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 at BL and SDZ were-31.8ug/m3/10yr (-4.3{\%}/yr) (p{\textless}0.01) and-13.3ug/m3/10yr (-2.9{\%}/yr) (p{\textless}0.05), respectively. In winter, the mean wind speed (Ws) and relative humidity (RH) were the most closely correlated with O3 at both stations, whereas RH and sunshine hours (S) were most closely correlated with PM2.5. The correlation coefficients and explained variances in spring and autumn were generally less than those in winter and greater than those in summer. Moreover, increase in precipitation can significantly reduce the PM2.5 concentration in both urban and rural areas in Beijing, whereas trace and light precipitation more effectively decreases the O3 concentration. Concentrations of PM2.5 (O3) on haze days increased by 114{\%} (3{\%}) and 162{\%} (20{\%}) compared with that on non-haze days at the urban and rural stations, respectively. This result suggests that haze is a major manifestation of air pollution in Beijing.},

abstract = {Aim To estimate the effect on assault of a series of legislative reforms that restricted the trading hours and trading conditions of licensed premises in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods We examine the effects of the legislative reforms introduced between July 2008 and January 2012 using time series structural models. These models are used to estimate the underlying long term dynamics of the time series of police recorded domestic and non-domestic assaults occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH) and assaults occasioning grievous bodily harm (GBH) in NSW between January 1996 and December 2013. The effect of the legislative changes is captured by including terms in the models which reflect a smooth step change in the number of assaults Results The reforms introduced between July 2008 and January 2012 were associated with a fall in levels of ABH and GBH assaults. The joint effect of all the interventions on ABH lasted until July 2013 accounting for a reduction of -31.27 per cent over that period (parameter estimate -0.38 with 95{\%} CI (-0.65,-0.10)). The same set of interventions had a greater effect on GBH assaults; achieving a -39.70{\%} reduction over a shorter period of time July 2008 and July 2012 (parameter estimate -0.51 with 95{\%} CI (-0.69,-0.33)). Conclusion. Legislative reforms introduced in New South Wales, Australia between July 2008 and January 2012 to restrict trading hours and trading conditions of licensed alcohol premises appear to have reduced the number of police-recorded assaults by over 30{\%}.},

abstract = {Count time series are frequently encountered in biomedical, epidemiological and public health applications. In principle, such series may exhibit three distinctive features: overdispersion, zero-inflation and temporal correlation. Developing a modelling framework that is sufficiently general to accommodate all three of these characteristics poses a challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a flexible class of dynamic models in the state-space framework. Certain models that have been previously introduced in the literature may be viewed as special cases of this model class. For parameter estimation, we devise a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm, where particle filtering and particle smoothing methods are employed to approximate the high-dimensional integrals in the E-step of the algorithm. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we consider an application based on the evaluation of a participatory ergonomics intervention, which is designed to reduce the incidence of workplace injuries among a group of hospital cleaners. The data consists of aggregated monthly counts of work-related injuries that were reported before and after the intervention.},

@article{Heinen2003,
abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates new models for time series count data. The Autoregressive Conditional Poisson model (ACP) makes it possible to deal with issues of discreteness, overdispersion (variance greater than the mean) and serial correlation. A fully parametric approach is taken and a marginal distribution for the counts is specified, where conditional on past observations the mean is autoregressive. This enables to attain improved inference on coeffcients of exogenous regressors relative to static Poisson regression, which is the main concern of the existing literature, while modelling the serial correlation in a flexible way. A variety of models, based on the double Poisson distribution of Efron (1986) is introduced, which in a first step introduce an additional dispersion parameter and in a second step make this dispersion parameter time-varying. All models are estimated using maximum likelihood which makes the usual tests available. In this framework autocorrelation can be tested with a straightforward likelihood ratio test, whose simplicity is in sharp contrast with test procedures in the latent variable time series count model of Zeger (1988). The models are applied to the time series of monthly polio cases in the U.S between 1970 and 1983 as well as to the daily number of price change durations of .75{\$} on the IBM stock. A .75{\$} price change duration is defined as the time it takes the stock price to move by at least .75{\$}. The variable of interest is the daily number of such durations, which is a measure of intradaily volatility, since the more volatile the stock price is within a day, the larger the counts will be. The ACP models provide good density forecasts of this measure of volatility.},

abstract = {Sea surface temperature fields (1870–2100) forced by CO 2 -induced climate change under the IPCC SRES A1B CO 2 scenario, from three World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (WCRP CMIP3) models (CCSM3, CSIRO MK 3.5, and GFDL CM 2.1), were used to examine how coral sensitivity to thermal stress and rates of adaption affect global projections of coral-reef bleaching. The focus of this study was two-fold, to: (1) assess how the impact of Degree-Heating-Month (DHM) thermal stress threshold choice affects potential bleaching predictions and (2) examine the effect of hypothetical adaptation rates of corals to rising temperature. DHM values were estimated using a conventional threshold of 1°C and a variability-based threshold of 2$\sigma$ above the climatological maximum Coral adaptation rates were simulated as a function of historical 100-year exposure to maximum annual SSTs with a dynamic rather than static climatological maximum based on the previous 100 years, for a given reef cell. Within CCSM3 simulations, the 1°C threshold predicted later onset of mild bleaching every 5 years for the fraction of reef grid cells where 1°C {\textgreater} 2$\sigma$ of the climatology time series of annual SST maxima (1961–1990). Alternatively, DHM values using both thresholds, with CSIRO MK 3.5 and GFDL CM 2.1 SSTs, did not produce drastically different onset timing for bleaching every 5 years. Across models, DHMs based on 1°C thermal stress threshold show the most threatened reefs by 2100 could be in the Central and Western Equatorial Pacific, whereas use of the variability-based threshold for DHMs yields the Coral Triangle and parts of Micronesia and Melanesia as bleaching hotspots. Simulations that allow corals to adapt to increases in maximum SST drastically reduce the rates of bleaching. These findings highlight the importance of considering the thermal stress threshold in DHM estimates as well as potential adaptation models in future coral bleaching projections.},

We employ an iterated random function approach and a special coupling technique to show that, under suitable conditions on the parameter space, the conditional mean process is a geometric moment contracting Markov chain and that the observation process is ab-solutely regular with geometrically decaying coefficients. Moreover the asymptotic theory of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters is established under some mild assumptions. These models are applied to two examples; the first is the number of transactions per minute of Ericsson stock and the second is related to return times of extreme events of Goldman Sachs Group stock.},

The global VAR (GVAR) model is estimated for 26 countries, the euro area being treated as a single economy, over the period 1979–2003. It advances research in this area in a number of directions. In particular, it provides a theoretical framework where the GVAR is derived as an approximation to a global unobserved common factor model. Using average pair-wise cross-section error correlations, the GVAR approach is shown to be quite effective in dealing with the common factor interdependencies and international co-movements of business cycles. It develops a sieve bootstrap procedure for simulation of the GVAR as a whole, which is then used in testing the structural stability of the parameters, and for establishing bootstrap confidence bounds for the impulse responses. Finally, in addition to generalized impulse responses, the current paper considers the use of the GVAR for ‘structural' impulse response analysis with focus on external shocks for the euro area economy, particularly in response to shocks to the US.},

The dependent variable is assumed to have a conditional exponential family distribution given the past history of the process. The model estimation is carried out using an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. Properties of the model, including stationarity and marginal moments, are either derived explicitly or investigated using Monte Carlo simulation. The relationship of the GARMA model to other models is shown, including the autoregressive models of Zeger and Qaqish, the moving average models of Li, and the reparameterized generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic GARCH model (providing the formula for its fourth marginal moment not previously derived). The model is demonstrated by the application of the GARMA model with a negative binomial conditional distribution to a well-known time series dataset of poliomyelitis counts.},

The COM- Poisson is a two-parameter extension of the Poisson distribution that generalizes some well-known discrete distributions (Poisson, Bernoulli, Geometric). It also leads to the generalization of distributions derived from these discrete distributions (viz. the Binomial and Negative Binomial). We describe three methods for estimating the COM-Poisson's parameters: The first is a fast simple weighted least squares method, which leads to estimates that are sufficiently accurate for practical purposes. The second method, using maximum likelihood, can be used to refine the initial estimates. This method requires iterations and is more computationally intensive. The third estimation method is Bayesian. Using the conjugate prior, the posterior density of the COM-Poisson parameters is easily computed. The COM-Poisson is a flexible distribution that can account for over/under dispersion commonly encountered in count data. We also explore two sets of real world data demonstrating the flexibility and elegance of the COM-Poisson in fitting count data which do not seem to follow the Poisson distribution.},

Success, however, can lead to its own costs: Users face a confusion of choice when trying to select packages in approaching a problem. A need to maintain workable examples using early methods may mean some tools offered as a default may be dated. In an open-source project like R, how to decide what tools offer “best practice” choices, and how to implement such a policy, present a serious challenge. We discuss these issues with reference to the tools in R for nonlinear parameter estimation (NLPE) and optimization, though for the present article ‘optimization‘ will be limited to function minimization of essentially smooth functions with at most bounds constraints on the parameters. We will abbreviate this class of problems as NLPE. We believe that the concepts proposed are transferable to other classes of problems seen by R users.},

abstract = {The first part of this article presents the Monte Carlo implementation of the E step of the EM algorithm. Given the current guess to the maximizer of the posterior distribution, latent data patterns are generated from the conditional predictive distribution. The expected value of the augmented log-posterior is then updated as a mixture of augmented log-posteriors, mixed over the generated latent data patterns (multiple imputations). In the M step of the algorithm, this mixture is maximized to obtain the update to the maximizer of the observed posterior. The gradient and Hessian of the observed log posterior are also expressed as mixtures, mixed over the multiple imputations. The relation between the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm and the data augmentation algorithm is noted. Two modifications to the MCEM algorithm (the poor man's data augmentation algorithms), which allow for the calculation of the entire posterior, are then presented. These approximations serve as diagnostics for the validity of the normal approximation to the posterior, as well as starting points for the full data augmentation analysis. The methodology is illustrated with two examples.},

abstract = {Ozone (O3) mixing ratios were measured at three different sites (urban/traffic, semi-rural and rural/island) in Istanbul from September 2007 to December 2009 in order to determine the diurnal, monthly and seasonal variations of O3 and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and to study the local and regional impacts. This is the first study that evaluates the O3 levels in semi-rural and rural sites in Istanbul in addition to the urban sites. The diurnal O3 variations are generally characterized by afternoon maxima (64ppb at the urban, 80ppb at the semi-rural and 100ppb at the rural site) and the nighttime minimum being more pronounced at the polluted urban site. The monthly mean O3 mixing ratios start to increase in March, reaching their maximum values in August for the urban ({\~{}}25ppb) and semi-rural sites (30ppb). However, at the rural site, the monthly mean O3 levels reach their maximum value in June (35ppb). The O3 mixing ratios for weekends were higher than those on weekdays at each site by up to 28{\%}, possibly due to changes in VOC sensitivity and reduction in NOx levels. In order to better understand and characterize the relationship between air masses and O3 levels, cluster analysis was applied to the back-trajectories calculated by the HYSPLIT model for the semi-rural site. The analyses clearly showed that major transport is characterized by northern and western clusters, particularly from the Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region, as well as recirculation over Istanbul due to high pressure systems leading to accumulated levels of O3. The results clearly suggest that extended measurement networks from urban to rural sites should be considered for a more comprehensive evaluation of O3 levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aims: To determine whether restrictions on the availability of alcohol in two inner-city entertainment areas in Sydney, Australia (1) reduced the incidence of assault in those areas, (2) increased the incidence of assault in nearby areas (where the restrictions did not apply), (3) resulted in a net reduction in overall levels of assault (4) and/or whether the reductions in assault were most pronounced during the daily time-periods when liquor trading restrictions were in operation. Design: Structural time-series modelling was used to estimate and compare trends in assault in areas/times affected by the new restrictions on alcohol availability with trends in assault in areas unaffected by the new restrictions. Setting: Sydney, Australia. Participants/measurements: The primary outcome measure was the police-recorded monthly incidence of non-domestic assault in the 78 months between January 2009 and June 2015. Findings: Following the reforms, we found reductions in assaults of 45{\%} [beta = -0.599, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = -1.107, -0.091] and 22{\%} (beta = 0.260, 95{\%} CI = -0.397, -0.123), respectively, in the Kings Cross and Sydney CBD Entertainment Precincts. In the Kings Cross Entertainment Precinct, reductions in assault were observed in all three daily time-periods. In the Sydney CBD Entertainment Precinct reductions in assault were observed only in the second and third daily time-periods. Assaults did not increase in entertainment areas adjacent to or within easy reach of the target areas. Conclusion: Restrictions on the availability of alcohol appear to reduce the incidence of assault. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Conway–Maxwell–Poisson (CMP) distributions are flexible generalizations of the Poisson distribution for modelling overdispersed or underdispersed counts. The main hindrance to their wider use in practice seems to be the inability to directly model the mean of counts, making them not compatible with nor comparable to competing count regression models, such as the log-linear Poisson, negative-binomial or generalized Poisson regression models. This note illustrates how CMP distributions can be parametrized via the mean, so that simpler and more easily interpretable mean-models can be used, such as a log-linear model. Other link functions are also available, of course. In addition to establishing attractive theoretical and asymptotic properties of the proposed model, its good finite-sample performance is exhibited through various examples and a simulation study based on real datasets. Moreover, the MATLAB routine to fit the model to data is demonstrated to be up to an order of magnitude faster than the curren...},

@article{Hall2004,
abstract = {Over the last decade or so, there has been increasing interest in ‘zero inflated' (ZI) regression models to account for ‘excess' zeros in data. Examples include ZI poisson (ZIP), ZI binomial (ZIB), ZI negative binomial and ZI tobit models. Recently, extensions of these models to the clustered data case have begun to appear. For example, Hall considered ZIP and ZIB models with cluster specific random effects. In this paper, we consider an alternative expectation maximization approach on the basis of marginal models and generalized estimating equation (GEE) methodology. In the usual EM algorithm for fitting ZI models, theMstep is replaced by the solution of a GEE to take into account within cluster correlation. The details of this approach, including formulas for an asymptotic variance–covariance matrix of parameter estimates, are given for several of the most important ZI regression model classes. Alternatively, GEEs can be applied directly by computing the first two marginal moments of the observed response. We illustrate these two marginal modeling approaches with examples, and compare them via a small simulation study.},

It is known that, if the innovations are assumed to follow a Poisson distribution then the marginal model is also Poisson. This model may however not be suitable for overdispersed count data. One frequent manifestation of overdispersion is that the incidence of zero counts is greater than expected from a Poisson model. In this paper, we introduce a new stationary first-order integer valued autoregressive process with zero inflated Poisson innovations. We derive some structural properties such as the mean, variance, marginal and joint distribution functions of the process. We consider estimation of the unknown parameters by conditional or approximate full maximum likelihood. We use simulation to study the limiting marginal distribution of the process and the performance of our fitting algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model by analyzing some real time series on animal health laboratory submissions.},

Dependence and tail properties of the model are obtained. The factor copula model can handle multivariate data with tail dependence and tail asymmetry, properties that the multivariate normal copula does not possess. It is a good choice for modeling high-dimensional data as a parametric form can be specified to have O (d) dependence parameters instead of O (d2) parameters. Data examples show that, based on the Akaike information criterion, the factor copula model provides a good fit to financial return data, in comparison with related truncated vine copula models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We study different approaches for modelling intervention effects in time series of counts, focusing on the so-called integer-valued GARCH models. A previous study treated a model where an intervention affects the non-observable underlying mean process at the time point of its occurrence and additionally the whole process thereafter via its dynamics. As an alternative, we consider a model where an intervention directly affects the observation at its occurrence, but not the underlying mean, and then also enters the dynamics of the process. While the former definition describes an internal change of the system, the latter can be understood as an external effect on the observations due to e.g. immigration. For our alternative model we develop conditional likelihood estimation and, based on this, tests and detection procedures for intervention effects. Both models are compared analytically and using simulated and real data examples. We study the effect of model misspecification and computational issues. Keywords:},

abstract = {Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation is a popular approach to solving many signal processing problems. Many of these problems cannot be solved analytically and so numerical techniques such as the method of scoring are applied. However, in many scenarios, it is desirable to modify the ML problem with the inclusion of additional side information. Often this side information is in the form of parametric constraints, which the ML estimate (MLE) must now satisfy. We unify the asymptotic constrained ML (CML) theory with the constrained Cramer-Rao bound (CCRB) theory by showing the CML estimate (CMLE) is asymptotically efficient with respect to the CCRB., We also generalize the classical method of scoring using the CCRB to include the constraints, satisfying the constraints after each iterate. Convergence properties and examples verify the usefulness of the constrained scoring approach. As a particular example, an alternative and more general CMLE is developed for the complex parameter linear model with linear constraints. A novel proof of the efficiency of this estimator is provided using the CCRB.},

Triggered by high ocean temperatures, bleaching events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity. Here, we provide a comprehensive global study of coral bleaching in terms of global mean temperature change, based on an extended set of emissions scenarios and models. We show that preserving {\textgreater}10{\%} of coral reefs worldwide would require limiting warming to below 1.5 °C (atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) range: 1.3–1.8 °C) relative to pre-industrial levels. Even under optimistic assumptions regarding corals' thermal adaptation, one-third (9–60{\%}, 68{\%} uncertainty range) of the world's coral reefs are projected to be subject to long-term degradation under the most optimistic new IPCC emissions scenario, RCP3-PD. Under RCP4.5 this fraction increases to two-thirds (30–88{\%}, 68{\%} uncertainty range). Possible effects of ocean acidification reducing thermal tolerance are assessed within a sensitivity experiment.},

The rate depends on whether $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 0 or $\alpha$ {\textless} 0. For the lower tail, the latter case has rate asymptotically identical with the bivariate normal ($\alpha$=0), but has a different multiplicative constant. The case $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 0 gives a rate dependent on $\alpha$. The detailed asymptotic behaviour of the quantile function for the univariate skew normal is a key.

abstract = {An “offline” approach to DA is used, where static ensemble samples are drawn from existing CMIP climate-model simulations to serve as the prior estimate of climate variables.We use linear, univariate forward models (“proxy systemmodels (PSMs)”) that map climate variables to proxy measurements by fitting proxy data to 2mair temperature fromgridded instrumental temperature data; the linear PSMs are then used to predict proxy values from the prior estimate. Results for the LMR are compared against six gridded instrumental temperature data sets and 25{\%} of the proxy records are withheld from assimilation for independent verification. Results show broad agreement with previous reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere mean 2mair temperature, with millennial-scale cooling, a multicentennial warm period around 1000 C.E., and a cold period coincident with the Little Ice Age (circa 1450–1800 C.E.). Verification against gridded instrumental data sets during 1880–2000 C.E. reveals greatest skill in the tropics and lowest skill over Northern Hemisphere land areas. Verification against independent proxy records indicates substantial improvement relative to the model (prior) data without proxy assimilation. As an illustrative example, we present multivariate reconstructed fields for a singular event, the 1808/1809 “mystery” volcanic eruption, which reveal global cooling that is strongly enhanced locally due to the presence of the Pacific-North America wave pattern in the 500 hPa geopotential height field},

Biometrical Journal, 47(2), 219-229.] compared the negative binomial and the generalized Poisson distributions. We aim at extending this comparison by including more distributions and more aspects, like tailness and kurtosis. We also aim at describing the related problem, whether from real data one may distinguish between the candidate models. To do this, we consider several aspects of three of the most commonly used mixed Poisson distributions, namely the negative binomial, the Poisson inverse Gaussian and the generalized Poisson distributions. The results show that for small mean and overdispersion, all the models are quite the same, whereas for larger means the generalized Poisson and the Poisson inverse Gaussian distributions have larger tails than the negative binomial, and the differences are much larger. In practice, it is not easy to discriminate between them for small counts and small overdispersion, but for large overdispersion discrimination is relatively easy. Applications to real data are provided to illustrate the ideas.},

abstract = {The implementation of sound quantitative risk models is a vital concern for all financial institutions, and this trend has accelerated in recent years with regulatory processes such as Basel II. This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the theoretical concepts and modelling techniques of quantitative risk management and equips readers--whether financial risk analysts, actuaries, regulators, or students of quantitative finance--with practical tools to solve real-world problems. The authors cover methods for market, credit, and operational risk modelling; place standard industry approaches on a more formal footing; and describe recent developments that go beyond, and address main deficiencies of, current practice. The book's methodology draws on diverse quantitative disciplines, from mathematical finance through statistics and econometrics to actuarial mathematics. Main concepts discussed include loss distributions, risk measures, and risk aggregation and allocation principles. A main theme is the need to satisfactorily address extreme outcomes and the dependence of key risk drivers. The techniques required derive from multivariate statistical analysis, financial time series modelling, copulas, and extreme value theory. A more technical chapter addresses credit derivatives.

They also derive the second order stationarity condition for the univariate mixture model up to arbitrary order.

This paper comprises an overview of the principal issues through a unified approach which encompasses both these situations. Novel diagnostic measures for dependence are also developed which provide complementary information about different aspects of extremal dependence. The paper is written in an elementary style, with the methodology illustrated by application to theoretical examples and typical data-sets.

abstract = {Prior work has shown that probability distributions of column water vapor and several passive tropospheric chemical tracers exhibit longer-than-Gaussian (approximately exponential) tails. The tracer-advection prototypes explaining the formation of these long-tailed distributions motivate exploration of observed surface temperature distributions for non-Gaussian tails. Stations with long records in various climate regimes in National Climatic Data Center Global Surface Summary of Day observations are used to examine tail characteristics for daily average, maximum and minimum surface temperature probability distributions. Each is examined for departures from a Gaussian fit to the core (here approximated as the portion of the distribution exceeding 30{\%} of the maximum). While the core conforms to Gaussian for most distributions, roughly half the cases exhibit non-Gaussian tails in both winter and summer seasons. Most of these are asymmetric, with a long, roughly exponential, tail on only one side. The shape of the tail has substantial implications for potential changes in extreme event occurrences under global warming. Here the change in the probability of exceeding a given threshold temperature is quantified in the simplest case of a shift in the present-day observed distribution. Surface temperature distributions with long tails have a much smaller change in threshold exceedances (smaller increases for high-side and smaller decreases for low-side exceedances relative to exceedances in current climate) under a given warming than do near-Gaussian distributions. This implies that models used to estimate changes in extreme event occurrences due to global warming should be verified regionally for accuracy of simulations of probability distribution tails.},

abstract = {Due to their high flexibility, yet simple structure, pair-copula constructions (PCCs) are becoming increasingly popular for constructing continuous multivariate distributions. However, inference requires the simplifying assumption that all the pair-copulae depend on the conditioning variables merely through the two conditional distribution functions that constitute their arguments, and not directly. In terms of standard measures of dependence, we express conditions under which a specific pair-copula decomposition of a multivariate distribution is of this simplified form. Moreover, we show that the simplified PCC in fact is a rather good approximation, even when the simplifying assumption is far from being fulfilled by the actual model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Count data with excess zeros are common in many biomedical and public health applications. The zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model has been widely used in practice to analyze such data. In this paper, we extend the classical ZIP regression framework to model count time series with excess zeros. A Markov regression model is presented and developed, and the partial likelihood is employed for statistical inference. Partial likelihood inference has been successfully applied in modeling time series where the conditional distribution of the response lies within the exponential family. Extending this approach to ZIP time series poses methodological and theoretical challenges, since the ZIP distribution is a mixture and therefore lies outside the exponential family. In the partial likelihood framework, we develop an EM algorithm to compute the maximum partial likelihood estimator (MPLE). We establish the asymptotic theory of the MPLE under mild regularity conditions and investigate its finite sample behavior in a simulation study. The performances of different partial-likelihood based model selection criteria are compared in the presence of model misspecification. Finally, we present an epidemiological application to illustrate the proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A complete guide to carrying out complex survey analysis using RAs survey analysis continues to serve as a core component of sociological research, researchers are increasingly relying upon data gathered from complex surveys to carry out traditional analyses. Complex Surveys is a practical guide to the analysis of this kind of data using R, the freely available and downloadable statistical programming language. As creator of the specific survey package for R, the author provides the ultimate presentation of how to successfully use the software for analyzing data from complex surveys while also utilizing the most current data from health and social sciences studies to demonstrate the application of survey research methods in these fields.The book begins with coverage of basic tools and topics within survey analysis such as simple and stratified sampling, cluster sampling, linear regression, and categorical data regression. Subsequent chapters delve into more technical aspects of complex survey analysis, including post-stratification, two-phase sampling, missing data, and causal inference. Throughout the book, an emphasis is placed on graphics, regression modeling, and two-phase designs. In addition, the author supplies a unique discussion of epidemiological two-phase designs as well as probability-weighting for causal inference. All of the book's examples and figures are generated using R, and a related Web site provides the R code that allows readers to reproduce the presented content. Each chapter concludes with exercises that vary in level of complexity, and detailed appendices outline additional mathematical and computational descriptions to assist readers with comparing results from various software systems.Complex Surveys is an excellent book for courses on sampling and complex surveys at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a practical reference guide for applied statisticians and practitioners in the social and health sciences who use statistics in their everyday work.},

Real data, however, are often over- or under-dispersed and, thus, not conducive to Poisson regression. We propose a regression model based on the Conway–Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) distribution to address this problem. The COM-Poisson regression generalizes the well-known Poisson and logistic regression models, and is suitable for fitting count data with a wide range of dispersion levels. With a GLM approach that takes advantage of exponential family properties, we discuss model estimation, inference, diagnostics, and interpretation, and present a test for determining the need for a COM-Poisson regression over a standard Poisson regression. We compare the COM-Poisson to several alternatives and illustrate its advantages and usefulness using three data sets with varying dispersion.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The Poisson regression model is the most common framework for modeling count data, but it is constrained by its equidispersion assumption. The hyper-Poisson regression model described in this paper generalizes it and allows for over- and under-dispersion, although, unlike other models with the same property, it introduces the regressors in the equation of the mean. Additionally, regressors may also be introduced in the equation of the dispersion parameter, in such a way that it is possible to fit data that present overdispersion and underdispersion in different levels of the observations. Two applications illustrate that the model can provide more accurate fits than those provided by alternative usual models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The modeling of such “clumped-at-zero” or “zero-inflated” data is challenging. We survey models that have been proposed. We consider cases in which the response for the non-zero observations is continuous and in which it is discrete. For the continuous and then the discrete case, we review models for analyzing cross-sectional data. We then summarize extensions for repeated measurement analyses (e.g., in longitudinal studies), for which the literature is still sparse. We also mention applications in which more than one clump can oc- cur and we suggest problems for future research.},

abstract = {We study the problem of intervention effects generating various types of outliers in a linear count time-series model. This model belongs to the class of observation-driven models and extends the class of Gaussian linear time-series models within the exponential family framework. Studies about effects of covariates and interventions for count time-series models have largely fallen behind, because the underlying process, whose behaviour determines the dynamics of the observed process, is not observed. We suggest a computationally feasible approach to these problems, focusing especially on the detection and estimation of sudden shifts and outliers. We consider three different scenarios, namely the detection of an intervention effect of a known type at a known time, the detection of an intervention effect when the type and the time are both unknown and the detection of multiple intervention effects. We develop score tests for the first scenario and a parametric bootstrap procedure based on the maximum of the different score test statistics for the second scenario. The third scenario is treated by a stepwise procedure, where we detect and correct intervention effects iteratively. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated using simulated and real data examples.},

We also show how an empirical profile likelihood can be used for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for parameters in the mean model, much in the same way as analysis-of-deviance techniques in classical generalized linear models. Small sample performance are examined via simulations and the method will be applied to some real data analysis examples.},

abstract = {Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is widely used to model the asset price dynamics. Option price models such as the Black-Sholes and the binomial tree models rely on the assumption that the underlying asset price dynamics follow the GBM. Modeling the asset price dynamics by using the GBM implies that the log return of assets at particular time is normally distributed. Many studies on real data in the markets showed that the GBM fails to capture the characteristic features of asset price dynamics that exhibit heavy tails and excess kurtosis. In our study, a class of Levy process, which is called a variance gamma (VG) process, performs much better than GBM model for modeling the dynamics of those stock indices. However, valuation of financial instruments, e.g. options, under the VG process has not been well developed. Here, we propose a new approach to the valuation of European option. It is based on the conditional distribution of the VG process. We also apply the path simulation model to value American options by assuming the underlying asset log return follow the VG process. Such a model is similar with that proposed by Tiley [1]. Simulation study shows that the proposed method performs well in term of the option price.},

Special attention is given to the issues of ergodicity and asymptotic theory of estimation. Two main approaches are mentioned, a perturbation approach and the use of a weak dependence concept. The main emphasis is on the former. Linear as well as log-linear and nonlinear models are treated. It is argued that the developed theory forms a necessary basis for modelling and application of these count time series. The setting of the paper is one of simple models and conditional distributions of Poisson type. But it is claimed that the frame- work is general enough to handle many extensions with an accompanying flexibility in applications of these models.},

abstract = {In this paper, parametric and empirical likelihood functions or surfaces are compared. In particular, first- and second-order expansions for log likelihood functions are developed in nonparametric and parametric situations, where the functional of interest is a smooth function of vector means. The two approaches are compared and the precise order of difference between the nonparametric and parametric log likelihood functions is obtained. In general, the surfaces need not agree to first order. However, in certain exponential family models, the surfaces are quite close in a distributional sense. Moreover, empirical likelihood can be thought of as an approximation to a true parametric likelihood based on a parametric least favourable family.},

@article{Davis2009,
abstract = {We study generalized linear models for time series of counts, where serial dependence is introduced through a dependent latent process in the link function. Conditional on the covariates and the latent process, the observation is modelled by a negative binomial distribution. To estimate the regression coefficients, we maximize the pseudolikelihood that is based on a generalized linear model with the latent process suppressed. We show the consistency and asymptotic normality of the generalized linear model estimator when the latent process is a stationary strongly mixing process. We extend the asymptotic results to generalized linear models for time series, where the observation variable, conditional on covariates and a latent process, is assumed to have a distribution from a one-parameter exponential family. Thus, we unify in a common framework the results for Poisson log-linear regression models of Davis et al. (2000), negative binomial logit regression models and other similarly specified generalized linear models.},

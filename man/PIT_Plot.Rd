)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object class "cmp", obtained from a call to \code{glm.cmp}.}

\item{bins}{numeric; the number of bins shown in the PIT histogram or the
PIT Q-Q plot.}

\item{line}{logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), the line for displaying the standard
uniform distribution will be shown for the purpose of comparison.}

\item{colLine}{numeric or character: the colour of the line for comparison
in PIT histogram.}

\item{colHist}{numeric or character; the colour of the histogram for PIT.}

\item{lwdLine}{numeric; the line widths for the comparison line in PIT histogram.}

\item{main}{character string; a main title for the plot.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to plot.default and plot.ts.}

\item{col1}{numeric or character; the colour of the sample uniform Q-Q plot in PIT.}

\item{col2}{numeric or character; the colour of the theoretical uniform Q-Q plot in PIT.}

\item{lty1}{integer or character string: the line types for the sample
uniform Q-Q plot in PIT, see par(lty = .).}

\item{lty2}{an integer or character string: the line types for the theoretical uniform
Q-Q plot in PIT, see par(lty = .).}

\item{type}{1-character string; the type of plot for the sample uniform Q-Q plot in PIT.}
}
\description{
Two plots for the non-randomized PIT are currently available for checking the
distributional assumption of the fitted CMP model: the PIT histogram, and
the uniform Q-Q plot for PIT.
}
\details{
The histogram and the Q-Q plot are used to compare the fitted profile with a standard
uniform distribution. If they match relatively well, it means the CMP distribution
is appropriate for the data.

The \code{gg_histcompPIT} and \code{gg_qqcompPIT} functions
would provide the same two plots but in ggplot format.

\title{Random Normal Probability Integral Transform}
\usage{
compnormRandPIT(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object class "cmp", obtained from a call to \code{glm.cmp}.}
}
\value{
A list consisting of two elements:
\item{rt}{the normal conditional randomized quantile residuals}
\item{rdMid}{the midpoints of the predictive probability intervals}
}
\description{
A function to create the normal conditional (randomized) quantile residuals.
The majority of the code and descriptions are taken from Dunsmuir and Scott (2015).
}
\details{
The function \code{compPredProb} produces the non-randomized probability integral
transform(PIT). It returns estimates of the cumulative predictive probabilities as
upper and lower bounds of a collection of intervals. If the model is correct, a
histogram drawn using these estimated probabilities should resemble a histogram
obtained from a sample from the uniform distribution.

This function aims to produce observations which instead resemble a sample from
a normal distribution. Such a sample can then be examined by the usual tools for
checking normality, such as histograms and normal Q-Q plots.

For each of the intervals produced by \code{compPredProb}, a random uniform observation
is generated, which is then converted to a normal observation by applying the inverse
standard normal distribution function (using \code{qnorm}). The vector of these values
is returned by the function in the list element \code{rt}. In addition non-random
observations which should appear similar to a sample from a normal distribution
are obtained by applying \code{qnorm} to the mid-points of the predictive distribution
intervals. The vector of these values is returned by the function in the list element
\code{rtMid}.

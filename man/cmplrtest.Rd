\title{Likelihood Ratio Test for nested COM-Poisson models}
\usage{
cmplrtest(object1, object2, digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{object1}{an object class 'cmp', obtained from a call to \code{glm.cmp}}

\item{object2}{an object class 'cmp', obtained from a call to \code{glm.cmp}}

\item{digits}{numeric; minimum number of significant digits to be used for most numbers.}
}
\description{
Perform a likelihood ratio chi-sqaured test between nested COM-Poisson models. 
The test statistics is calculated as \emph{2*(llik- llik_0)}. The test statistics 
has degrees of freedom \emph{r} where \emph{r} is the difference in the number of 
parameters between the full and null models.
}
\details{
Obviously the comparison between two models will only be valid if they are fitted 
to the same data set.
}
\examples{
data(takeoverbids)

## Fit full model 
M.bids.full <- glm.cmp(numbids ~ leglrest + rearest + finrest + whtknght 
    + bidprem + insthold + size + sizesq + regulatn, data=takeoverbids)
    
## Fit null model; without whtknght
M.bids.null <- update(M.bids.full, .~.-whtknght)     
    
## Likelihood ratio test for the nested models
cmplrtest(M.bids.full, M.bids.null) # order of objects is not important

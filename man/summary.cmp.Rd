\title{Summary of COM-Poisson Model Fit}
\usage{
\method{summary}{cmp}(object, digits = max(3L, getOption("digits") - 3L),
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object class 'cmp', obtained from a call to \code{glm.cmp}.}

\item{digits}{numeric; minimum number of significant digits to be used for most numbers.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to or from other methods  (currently unused).}
}
\description{
\code{summary} method for class \code{cmp}.
}
\details{
\code{summary.glm} tries to be smart about formatting the coefficients, standard errors 
and gives 'significance stars'. The \code{coefficients} component of the result gives the 
estimated coefficients and their estimated standard errors, together with their ratio. This 
third column is labelled as \code{Z value} as the dispersion is fixed for this family. A
forth column gives the two-tailed p-value corresponding to \code{Z value} based on 
the asymptotic Normal reference distribution.
